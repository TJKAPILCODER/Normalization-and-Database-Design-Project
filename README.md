# Normalization-and-Database-Design-Project
Designed and developed databases for two two fictional local businesses to help them manage their businesses using MYSQL. Designed a normalized physical database model to store data for Nora’s Bagel Bin’s ordering system. Used an existing database design document for Jaunty Coffee Co. to create its database. After the tables were been built, they were loaded with sample data. A database view and an index to protect and improve query performance was created. Crafted a simple query and a more complex table joins query to produce meaningful reports from the newly created database.
